## Org-roam {#org-roam}

Lets me keep linked notes. It's a solid alternative to Logseq and Obsidian. I can build my own knowledge base, linking notes together to see their relationships clearly.


## Org-roam-ui {#org-roam-ui}

Adds a web interface for Org-roam. It lets me look at my notes visually, like a network graph. Think of it like a map where I can easily see the connections between my notes.


## Gptel {#gptel}

Powers up Emacs with AI. It supports local models and can connect remotely, like with GPT. Super handy for coding, content creation, or any language-based tasks.


## Avy {#avy}

Lets me quickly jump to a word or character. Speeds up navigation, especially in large files. I can jump right to where my eyes land without using the mouse.


## Magit {#magit}

A Git package for Emacs. It’s got everything I need—staging, committing, branch management—all handled inside Emacs. If I’m working with Git, Magit is a must-have.
