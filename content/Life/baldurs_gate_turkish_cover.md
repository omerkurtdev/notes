Baldur’s Gate 3 has fully immersed me in its world, making me feel like I've left reality behind. The depth of each character and the impact of my choices make the game feel incredibly personal. Character creation is an adventure, and each battle requires strategic thought, which keeps things fresh. The game’s dark, mysterious atmosphere captivates me, and the music, with its intense and emotional tones, amplifies the experience. I have to mention Minachua’s Turkish covers—they’re amazing, and I’ll be sharing a couple of them.
